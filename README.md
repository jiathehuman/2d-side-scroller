# 2d-side-scroller
I am excited to share my first game project affectionately nicknamed Robot. It is a 2D side-scrolling platform game developed using p5.js's library. This project has been an incredible journey into the world of mini-game development and programming.

**Key Features**
1. Classic platform experience: This project is inspired by classic platformers, with a modern pastel spin on the design.
2. Interactive Elements: With robot, the protagonist of the game, you can jump around, collect items and avoid enemies! Simply use your arrow keys and space bar to navigate!

**Technical Highlights**
Through this project, I learned the importance of encapsulation and abstraction. Using classes and constructor functions, I made reusable modules that can be used in future game projects. I implemented basic collision detection with the game's platforms, canyons and enemies. 

**Future Plans**
Looking ahead, I plan to learn to use more complex libraries, such as matter.js, to enhance gameplay mechanics.
